Submit a Spark Job From Java Code
=================================
In this post I will show you how to submit a Spark job from Java code. Typically, 
we submit Spark jobs to "Spark Cluster" (standalone Spark cluster) and Hadoop/YARN 
(MapReduce/Hadoop cluster) by using the ````$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit```` shell 
script.  Submitting Spark job from a shell script limits programmers when they want 
to submit Spark jobs from Java code (such as Java servlets or other Java code such 
as REST servers).
